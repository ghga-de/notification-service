This is a Python-based service following the Triple Hexagonal Architecture pattern.
It uses protocol/provider pairs and dependency injection mechanisms provided by the
[hexkit](https://github.com/ghga-de/hexkit) library.

### Typical operation

This service doesn't have a REST API or use a database for anything.
It's a straightforward service running a Kafka consumer that listens for one kind of event.
Notification events are picked up by the consumer, validated against the Notification event schema, and sent to the Notifier module.
The Notifier looks at the notification event details and determines what to do with it.
Right now, this always means sending an email.
The information is sent to the SMTP client, where a secure connection is established and the email is dispatched.

### Testing
The only notable thing about the test setup is that it uses a local test server (tests/fixtures/server.py) via aiosmtpd, which has sort of replaced the old smtpd module. There is a DummyServer, which has an 'expect_email()' method that is used similarly to the expect_events() method from hexkit's kafka testing module. It can perform simple a authentication check so error handling can be tested. When an email is sent to the test server, the connection is closed and the received/expected emails are compared to make sure that the header and body content is intact. This enables testing the flow of sending an email without actually issuing any real emails and without using real credentials.
