    Reason: The collection itself is still used, but the prior data is no longer valid.
    The old format stored a hash sum + sent flag. The new version stores the
    event ID plus the sent flag. We cannot meaningfully migrate the old data, and it
    cannot be used going forward. This migration drops the content and allows it to
    be recycled by the new service version.

    This is obviously not reversible.
